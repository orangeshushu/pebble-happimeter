# Pebble Happimeter
###### A COINs Project by University of Bamberg, University of Cologne, and University of Jilin

Our mind feels and our body senses when we are happy – or unhappy. Knowing when we are happy, and telling others about it will make them and us happier.

*Goal*: Build a body sensing system that measures and visualizes our happiness. It will consist of a Smartwatch or Android (later also iPhone) App that polls us 5-7 times per day to collect our emotional states. At the same time a Pebble smartwatch will collect a variety of body readings (temperature, light, steps, sleep, speech, energy,…).

*Research Hypothesis*: Comparing Pebble sensor readings with emotional state will allow us to correlate mood state with Pebble readings to automatically calculate mood state from Pebble sensor readings.
